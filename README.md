# Intro_to_ComplexSystems-Kuramoto
Spontaneous synchronisation for the Kuramoto model - Assignment for the Introduction to Complex Systems Course @ Utrecht University, Dec'19-Jan'20. Main simulations will run with a C code, plotting and analysis on Python

### To do:
  - Implementation for multiple runs on same parameters: imagine how to save file in useful way

### Ideas:
  - Average of Fourier analysis for different K-s in order to relate coupling strenght to characteristic oscillations of the Kuramoto systems (note: averaging and then Fourier would just result in suppression of modes..)
  
### To say in the report:
  - Chosing coding language --> benchmarks
  - Organization of workflow
  - First Euler approach: full hamiltonian
  - Second Euler approach: mean field --> lower computational times --> averaging EVERY results with good enough parameters 
  #### Issues:
    - Controlling random: not too fast! [not working on smaller simulations]
