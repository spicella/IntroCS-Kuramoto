Code for generating configurations and results for bonus part

Note that the C code for simulating the WS model can feed in whatever list representative of edges connections in a graph in the format [From  To  DegreePerVertex]. Therefore, the very same code can be used for simulating a Kuramoto system on whatever graph, provided that the correct format of the edges map is provided.
